# Weather Dashboard

* Weather dashboard for searching weather data and forcast by city.

* Weather data provided by Open Weahter API. 

* Imported Google Fonts and jQuery CDNs.

* User can retrieve current weather data and five day forecast for any city.

* Created HTML page with divs to render weather data dynamically.

* Added styling to CSS to change UV color based on index.

* Created three ajax calls to get the current weather, uv index and five day forecast.

* Data is rendered dynamically based on the most recent data from the API.

* Still working on completing local storage and styling.
